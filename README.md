# pandas-challenge trend observations



# 1. Gender

# Although there is a disparaging difference in the gender purchase count between male and female, the lesser amount of female purchases allowed for greater price value than the males. This is proven by the 18 cent difference in average purchase price, in addition to the average total purchase per person being 40 cents higher. Males are the clearly the primary gender demographic with interest in the games, but the females produced higher average purchases, thus showing that their market is formidable despite having less players in comparison to males.



# 2. Age

# Looking at the data in regard to age demographics, the clear trend is that the primary range of top purchasers are in the 15-19 and 20-24 range. This is fitting for modern gaming culture as high school through college people are the most well-known to show heavy interest in the hobby. However the continuity of the purchase counts in the data is dependent on exactly how many in the demographics are at the tail end. A key example would be a 24 year-old that will enter the next demographuc the following year. If they already exhibit a high purchase price, it will decrease the dollar value of the most popular demographic, but boost the succeeding one. 





# 3. Profitability

# The last trend I noticed in this data was that the more expensive items turned the most profit amongst the users. Based on the fact that most of them had the highest purchase counts too, this meant that they offered the best production and general excitement for the user.
